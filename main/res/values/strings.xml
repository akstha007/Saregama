The bansuri is capable of producing just over 2 and a half octaves\n\n
     After you learn how to play the notes SA RE GA MA PA DHA NI SA, you can begin to practice playing the Excercise notes. You can go to Ecercise notes from Home page or Navigation Menu. The sequences provided in Excercise Notes are called "Alankaar" or "Palta" in Hindi and mean "Ornamentation" or patterns of notes.
As a beginner you should learn to play them as slowly as possible because this will train your brain. Try playing at varying speeds once mastered.</string>
